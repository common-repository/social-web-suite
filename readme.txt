== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Is Social Web Suite? =

Social Web Suite is a social media marketing platform that allows you to manage, schedule, and track social media postings across multiple accounts and platforms. Think of it as your own customizable social media team, ready to take over everyday tasks like managing regular postings, and more advanced ones like mining old content and providing analytics. Social Web Suite unties you from the grind of social media and lets you get back to focusing on what matters most. Social Web Suite integrates with your WordPress blog using a lightweight WordPress social share plugin.

= That Sounds Great! How Do I Get Started? =

Getting started with Social Web Suite couldn’t be easier. Click [here](https://app.socialwebsuite.com/register) to sign up, take a few seconds to install the WordPress plugin, and go! Really, that’s it!

= How Much Does All That Glorious Power And Convenience Cost? =

Social Web Suite’s complete professional plans cost less per day than a drive through cup of bad coffee, or a single accidental roaming text. Everyone values their time differently, but we feel like the precious hours you have to waste on managing social media are worth more than that. You can check out our full range of pricing plans [here](https://socialwebsuite.com/pricing/).

= How Do I Use Social Web Suite? If I’m New To All This, Will I Be Lost? =

We designed Social Web Suite to be as easy to use as posting a regular Facebook status or making a simple calendar entry. We’re here to make things easier, not more complicated. Check out our how-to videos [here](https://vimeo.com/socialwebsuite) if you want to become a social media wizard in a matter of minutes.

= Is Social Web Suite able to share all WordPress posts automatically to all our Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts? =

Yes, it is. You can definitively WordPress auto post to Facebook with Social Web Suite.

You can schedule all your posts to be shared automatically by your predefined days and times to be sent to all your Twitter profiles, Facebook pages, and groups, and LinkedIn profiles and pages. Our algorithm then recycles your old posts based on your predefined settings.

You can also choose to share your posts immediately when they got published in WordPress, or when they are scheduled in WordPress, or even when they are updated in WordPress.

For your special deals and promotions that are date sensitive, you can even schedule your posts to be shared only between specific dates and times with our WordPress auto post social media platform.

= Social Web Suite should work in the background so our writers don’t have to do anything when they post a normal WordPress post =
Once you set up the “post on publish” option on our platform your writers can just write the posts and that is it.

Our WordPress auto post social media platform will work in the background to make sure that your posts are always shared.

= Does Social Web Suite comes setup already or do I have to do everything?  =
When you first connect your WordPress site to Social Web Suite there are some pre-default settings already set up for you.

If you are okay with that, you can start WordPress auto post to social media immediately or if you want, you can tweak the settings per your liking, too.

= Does Social Web Suite supports Gutenberg?  =
Yes, it does support Gutenberg!

= Does Social Web Suite supports WooCommerce?  =
Yes, it does support WooCommerce!

= I Don’t See My Question Answered Here! Help! =
